\# Green AI: Energy-Efficient Machine Learning for Environmental Monitoring



This repository contains the datasets, code, and experiments for the thesis  

\*\*“Design and Optimization of Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence Models for Environmental Monitoring.”\*\*



The project evaluates energy-aware AI techniques such as \*\*model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation\*\*

applied to environmental datasets (air quality and weather), with a focus on \*\*accuracy, inference latency, and CO₂ emissions\*\*.
